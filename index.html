                    <h2>Macronutrients</h2>
                    <p>
                        Macronutrients are the chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest
                        quantities. They provide the bulk of the energy and are classified as
                        carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

                    <h3>Fats</h3>
                    <p>
                    Fats consist of a glycerin molecule with three fatty acids attached.
                    Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched hydrocarbon chains
                    connected by single bonds alone (saturated fatty acids) or by both double and single
                    bonds (unsaturated fatty acids).
                    Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of cell membranes, to maintain a
                    stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair.
                    Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids
                    (termed <em>essential fatty acids</em>), they must be obtained through one's diet.

                    <h3>Proteins</h3>
                    <p>
                    Proteins are organic compounds that consist of amino acids joined by peptide bonds.
                    Since the body cannot manufacture some of the amino acids
                    (termed <em>essential amino acids</em>), the diet must supply them.
                    Through digestion, proteins are broken down by proteases back into free amino acids.

                    <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
                    <p>
                    Carbohydrates are compounds made up of types of sugar. Carbohydrates are classified
                    according to their number of sugar units: monosaccharides
                    (such as glucose and fructose), disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose),
                    oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides (such as starch, glycogen, and cellulose).
